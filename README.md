# Topo roadmap

This repository contains the [LINZ Topography data publishing public roadmap](https://github.com/linz/topo-roadmap/projects/1?fullscreen=true). This is where you can learn about what datasets we're working on publishing, and when we expect to make them available.

## Guide to the roadmap

Roadmap items are new datasets or dataset updates that are stored as issues, with labels that describe the following:

- A **dataset** that indicates the dataset or dataset group of the roadmap item
- A **coverage** that indicates the breadth of the area that the update covers
- **Publishing channels** that indicates where the new dataset or dataset update will be made available
- A **publishing phase** that indicates when a new dataset or dataset update has been published

For further detail on the specific labels used to categorise the datasets and dataset updates, see below.

### Quarterly timeframes

The roadmap is arranged into periods of three months - these include the previous quarter, the current quarter and two future quarters. Datasets that aren't expected to be published until beyond this timeframe will be shown in a 'Future' column.

### Datasets

- **satellite imagery**
- **aerial imagery**
- **lidar**
- **topo50 map series**
- **building outlines**

### Coverage

- **city/district**: The dataset or dataset update is at a city or district level
- **regional**: The dataset or dataset update is at a regional level. In some cases this may be part of a region, but more than any one city or district
- **national**: The dataset or dataset update covers the entire New Zealand mainland
- **selected updates**: The dataset or dataset updates occur in various locations around the New Zealand mainland, rather than a single cohesive geographic area

### Publishing channels

Each issue contains direct links to the dataset or dataset update in each of the relevant publishing channels, as soon as it has been published.

- **linz data service**: The [LINZ Data Service](https://data.linz.govt.nz/) - LINZ's open data publishing platform
- **basemaps**: [LINZ Basemaps](https://basemaps.linz.govt.nz) - authoritative aerial imagery basemap
- **map chooser**: [LINZ Map Chooser](https://www.linz.govt.nz/land/maps/linz-topographic-maps/map-chooser) - tool for downloading individual Topo50 map series image files
- **open topography**: [Open Topography](https://portal.opentopography.org/dataCatalog?loc=New%20Zealand) - access to point cloud downloads for LINZ elevation datasets

### Publishing phase

- **data capture underway**: Data capture is underway by a supplier
- **awaiting data**: Waiting to receive data from a supplier. This may occur after QC has been completed if corrections need to be made
- **data received**: The dataset or dataset update has been received from the supplier and is awaiting QC
- **qc in progress**: The dataset or dataset update is going through LINZ's QC processes
- **in progress**: The dataset creation or dataset update is underway internally at LINZ
- **published**: The dataset or dataset update is publicly available

This roadmap is based on information available to LINZ as of the date that the roadmap items are created or updated, and LINZ assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking roadmap items. The roadmap does not represent a commitment, guarantee, obligation or promise to deliver any dataset or dataset update, or to deliver any dataset or dataset update by a particular date, and is intended to outline general data publishing plans.
