# Topo roadmap

This repository contains the [LINZ Topography data publishing public roadmap](https://github.com/linz/topo-roadmap/projects/1?fullscreen=true). This is where you can learn about what datasets we're working on publishing, and when we expect to make them available.

## Guide to the roadmap

Roadmap items are new datasets or dataset updates that are stored as issues, with labels that describe the following:

- A **dataset** that indicates the dataset or dataset group of the roadmap item
- A **coverage** that indicates the breadth of the area that the update covers
- **Publishing channels** that indicates where the new dataset or dataset update will be made available
- A **publishing phase** that indicates when a new dataset or dataset update has been published

For further detail on the specific labels used to categorise the datasets and dataset updates, see below.

### Quarterly timeframes

The roadmap is arranged into periods of three months - these include the previous quarter, the current quarter and two future quarters. Datasets that aren't expected to be published until beyond this timeframe will be show in a 'Future' column.

### Datasets

- **satellite imagery**
- **aerial imagery**
- **lidar**
- **topo50 map series**
- **building outlines**

### Coverage

- **city/district**: The dataset or dataset update is at a city or district level
- **regional**: The dataset or dataset update is at a regional level. In some cases this may be part of a region, but more than any one city or district
- **national**: The dataset or dataset update covers the entire New Zealand mainland
- **selected updates**: The dataset or dataset updates occur in various locations around the New Zealand mainland, rather than a single cohesive geographic area

### Publishing channels

- **linz data service**: The [LINZ Data Service](https://data.linz.govt.nz/) - LINZ's open data publishing platform
- **basemaps**: [LINZ Basemaps](https://basemaps.linz.govt.nz) - authoritative aerial imagery basemap
- **map chooser**: [LINZ Map Chooser](https://www.linz.govt.nz/land/maps/linz-topographic-maps/map-chooser) - tool for downloading individual Topo50 map series image files
- **basedata.nz**: [Base Data NZ](https://basedata.nz) - datasets mirrored from the LINZ Data Service for use in ArcGIS Online and as ArcGIS REST services
- **open topography**: [Open Topography](https://portal.opentopography.org/dataCatalog?loc=New%20Zealand) - access to point cloud downloads for LINZ elevation datasets

### Publishing phase

- **published**: The dataset or dataset update is publicly available
- **delayed**: The dataset or dataset update has been delayed - check the issue for further information
